						<p>Our company culture can be described as open/informal. We welcome contributors' ideas and efforts to grow our brand.</p>
						<p>We are committed to expanding our product offerings. We want to be your go-to store for easy, comfortable elegance.</p>
						<p>As we grow, we want to maintain a predominantly U.S. made product line with perhaps a few items, which are clearly labeled, included to also make a difference for workers outside the U.S.</p>
