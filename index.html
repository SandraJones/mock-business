							<h3>Company Mission</h3>
							<p>Our mission is to empower women through training and opportunity using our unique scarves.</p>
							<p>We have the scarves cut out by a non-profit in Cleveland, Ohio that employs people with disabilities. A second non-profit provides women with training and work opportunities as seamstresses. They are paid a fair wage for their efforts and provide a beautiful, high quality, hand-made product.</p>

							<h3>Company History</h3>
							<p>Necklascarf is part of EverExpand Inc., which was formed in 2013 by Terri Brewer. Terri had an idea for a product to make wearing a scarf easy. She had a drawer full of scarves she never wore because she didn't want to fool with tying them. So, she came up with an idea to make wearing a scarf as easy as wearing a necklace. She invented the Necklascarf magnet-clasp closure. She and her husband wanted to keep it made in U.S.A. to provide jobs. They found a non-profit who could guarantee training and fair wages for the seamstresses involved. Terri then began showing her gorgeous scarves at booths during Christmas in upscale Crossings Courtyard. She was inundated with ladies wanting more scarves, so she increased inventory, opened a store online, and expanded into Amazon. </p>
							<h3>Company Employees</h3><p>Terri is the sole proprietor but does employ casual labor from time to time to man her booth or to work on her online stores.</p>
